# Venice_Lagoon_hydrodynamics

Repository to collect the comparison between hydrodynamics in the North Adriatic Sea and the same area including the Venice Lagoon.

Starting point: bathymetry of the Lagoon
1. interpolation of the bathymetry contained in the file Corila2013 onto the 1/128_rescaled bathymetry
2. adjust the values of depth with the value in the channel bathymetry (2013)

Simulations: WIP
